# Problem 2: C++ Programming - Vector Operations with Clue

## 🎯 Objective

Use the clue from Problem 1 to solve a vector manipulation problem and generate a clue for Problem 3.

## 📝 Description

This program should:

1. Use the positions from Problem 1's clue as indices
2. Create a vector and perform operations at those specific positions
3. Calculate a result that becomes the clue for Problem 3

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **2 Logical Errors**: Check vector operations and algorithm logic
- **2 Syntax Errors**: Look for incorrect syntax and missing elements

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
cd problem2-cpp
g++ challenge.cpp -o challenge
./challenge
```

## 💡 Expected Input

Use the clue from Problem 1: `[0, 2, 4, 6]`

## 💡 Expected Output

```
Using clue from Problem 1: [0, 2, 4, 6]
Vector: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
Values at clue positions: 10, 30, 50, 70
Sum of values: 160
Clue for Python problem: FIBONACCI_160
```

## 🔗 What to do next

1. Look at Problem 1's solution comment to get the clue
2. Fix all 4 errors in `challenge.cpp`
3. Compile and run to get the clue
4. Paste **ONLY the clue** in the solution comment at the end of the file
5. Commit and push your changes
6. Notify Member 3 to pull and start Problem 3
