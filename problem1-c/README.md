# Problem 1: C Programming - Prime Number Array

## 🎯 Objective

Fix the C program that finds prime numbers in an array and outputs a clue for the next problem.

## 📝 Description

This program should:

1. Check each number in the array to see if it's prime
2. Count the total number of prime numbers found
3. Output the positions (indices) of prime numbers as the clue for Problem 2

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **2 Logical Errors**: Check the prime number algorithm and array indexing
- **2 Syntax Errors**: Look for missing punctuation and incorrect operators

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
cd problem1-c
gcc challenge.c -o challenge
./challenge
```

## 💡 Expected Output

```
Array: [17, 8, 13, 4, 29, 6, 11, 15]
Prime numbers found: 17, 13, 29, 11
Prime positions: [0, 2, 4, 6]
Clue for C++ problem: [0, 2, 4, 6]
```

## 🔗 What to do next

1. Fix all 4 errors in `challenge.c`
2. Compile and run to get the clue
3. Paste **ONLY the clue** in the solution comment at the end of the file
4. Commit and push your changes
5. Notify Member 2 to pull and start Problem 2
