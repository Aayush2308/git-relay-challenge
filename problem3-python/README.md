# Problem 3: Python - Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## 🎯 Objective

Use the clue from Problem 2 to generate a Fibonacci sequence and create a clue for the final problem.

## 📝 Description

This program should:

1. Parse the clue from Problem 2 (e.g., "FIBONACCI_160")
2. Extract the number (160) and use it to determine Fibonacci sequence length
3. Generate the sequence and format it as a clue for Problem 4

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **2 Logical Errors**: Check Fibonacci generation and string operations
- **2 Syntax Errors**: Look for incorrect function calls and operators

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
cd problem3-python
python challenge.py
```

or

```bash
python3 challenge.py
```

## 💡 Expected Input

Use the clue from Problem 2: `FIBONACCI_160`

## 💡 Expected Output

```
Using clue from Problem 2: FIBONACCI_160
Extracted number: 160
Fibonacci sequence length: 8 (160 // 20)
Fibonacci sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
Clue for final problem: JAVA_SORT_[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13]
```

## 🔗 What to do next

1. Look at Problem 2's solution comment to get the clue
2. Fix all 4 errors in `challenge.py`
3. Run to get the clue
4. Paste **ONLY the clue** in the solution comment at the end of the file
5. Commit and push your changes
6. Notify Member 4 to pull and start the final Problem
