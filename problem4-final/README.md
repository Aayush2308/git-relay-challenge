# Problem 4: Final Challenge - Java Array Sorter

## 🎯 Objective

Use the clue from Problem 3 to complete the final challenge and reveal the ultimate solution!

## 📝 Description

This program should:

1. Parse the clue from Problem 3 (e.g., "JAVA*SORT*[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13]")
2. Extract the array and sort it using a custom sorting algorithm
3. Reveal the final solution by combining all team efforts

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **2 Logical Errors**: Check sorting algorithm and array parsing
- **2 Syntax Errors**: Look for incorrect syntax and missing elements

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
cd problem4-final
javac challenge.java
java Challenge
```

## 💡 Expected Input

Use the clue from Problem 3: `JAVA_SORT_[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13]`

## 💡 Expected Output

```
Using clue from Problem 3: JAVA_SORT_[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13]
Extracted array: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
Array after custom sort: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
FINAL SOLUTION: The team successfully solved all 4 problems!
Team completed: C → C++ → Python → Java relay!
```

## 🔗 What to do next

1. Look at Problem 3's solution comment to get the clue
2. Fix all 4 errors in `challenge.java`
3. Compile and run to reveal the final solution
4. Paste **ONLY the final solution message** in the solution comment
5. Commit and push your changes
6. Celebrate with your team! 🎉

## 🏆 Victory Condition

Successfully completing this problem means your team has:

- Solved 4 different programming languages
- Demonstrated Git collaboration skills
- Fixed 16 total errors (4 per problem)
- Passed clues correctly through the relay
